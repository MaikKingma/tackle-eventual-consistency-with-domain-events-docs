# 3: Theory - Solutions

In the Java context, several technologies and frameworks can facilitate handling eventual consistency, particularly in 
distributed systems. Here are some popular options:

### Apache Kafka:
A distributed streaming platform that enables handling of event-driven architecture and eventual 
consistency by providing a publish-subscribe messaging system. Kafka can be used to produce, store, and consume domain 
events, allowing asynchronous communication between services and facilitating eventual consistency.

### Spring Cloud Stream:
A framework for building message-driven microservices using Spring Boot and various messaging 
systems like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and others. Spring Cloud Stream simplifies the implementation of domain events 
and event-driven architecture, making it easier to manage eventual consistency in Java applications.

### Axon Framework:
An event-driven and domain-driven design (DDD) framework for Java that simplifies the 
implementation of event sourcing, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and domain events. Axon handles the 
complexities of event-driven architecture, allowing developers to focus on the business logic and ensuring eventual 
consistency.

### Eventuate: 
A platform for developing event-driven and eventually consistent microservices using event sourcing and 
CQRS patterns. Eventuate supports various messaging systems like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ. It offers a high-level
API for writing event-driven applications and supports multiple languages, including Java.

### Lagom: 
A microservices framework designed for Java and Scala developers, built on top of the Play Framework and Akka. 
Lagom offers features like event sourcing and CQRS out-of-the-box, making it easier to implement domain events and 
manage eventual consistency in distributed systems.

### Vert.x:
A toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM, which provides an event-driven, non-blocking 
development model. Vert.x can be used with messaging systems like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle domain events and 
implement eventual consistency in Java applications.

These technologies can be used individually or combined, depending on your application requirements and architecture. 
By leveraging these tools, developers can better manage eventual consistency in Java applications, particularly in 
distributed systems.
