# 6: Hands-On - Add domain event support

## Status Quo
We got to know the domain in section 4. In our application we are able to register authors, write books and publish them.

### The command
For that purpose I prepared the ``/commands/book/BookCommands.java`` class containing our new command API endpoint:

```http request
POST /books/{id}/commands/publish HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "publisherId": "80553ae1-2ef8-4adf-8fa8-d551684a9ea3"
}
```
Currently, this endpoint checks, whether a book can be published and if so sets it into a publishing state and persists it to the DB.
Our task now is to trigger a domain event that represents this publishing action. This published domain event can then be processed
asynchronously to trigger other actions connected to the publishing request, such as the confirmation of a domain external publisher.

## Task: Implement the domain event support
We want to allow a publishing request and, since we aim for eventual consistency, the publishing of a related domain
event, that can be consumed later on by our process adapter.
To be able to handle domain events in Spring, we need to add a new dependency in our ``pom.xml``:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-commons</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The challenge of this task is on the one hand to actually register domain events on the domain entity, but then also map them to
the actual JPA entity which will eventually be persisted by the Repository. That in turn will trigger the handling of
domain events in the ``AbstractAggregateRoot.java``. If we sent domain events from the domain layer already, we
could encounter a chicken and egg problem, since the domain event would be sent before the JPA entity is persisted and a possible 
roll back would leave us in an inconsistent state.

Here are some useful snippets. Can you implement them in the correct places?
```java
    @Getter
    private final List<DomainEvent> domainEvents = new ArrayList<>();
```
Our abstract base Domain event
```java
    public abstract class DomainEvent {}
```
and the actual publishing event we want to trigger when publishing was requested.
```java
    @Value
    public static class RequestPublishingEvent extends DomainEvent {
        Long bookId;
        UUID publisherId;
    }
```

The following snippet provides us the support for handling the Domain events correctly in our JPA entity.
```java
public class BookJPA extends AbstractAggregateRoot<BookJPA> {
    // ...
    public void registerDomainEvents(List<DomainEvent> domainEvents) {
      domainEvents.forEach(this::andEvent);
    }
}
```

In order to test the complete flow you will need to trigger the publishing of a book and then check whether the 
domain event was published correctly.
```http request
### Register an author first
POST /authors/commands/register HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "PLACE_YOUR_FIRST_NAME",
  "lastName": "PLACE_YOUR_LAST_NAME"
}


### Then write a book
### TODO chnage the author id to something that exists in your DB
POST /authors/10001/commands/writeBook HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "PLACE_YOUR_TILE",
  "genre": "HORROR"
}


### ThenPublish a book
### TODO change the book id to something that exists in your DB and the publisherID to one that exists on your local
### instance of the publishing service
POST /books/10008/commands/publish HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "publisherId": "80553ae1-2ef8-4adf-8fa8-d551684a9ea3"
}
```
