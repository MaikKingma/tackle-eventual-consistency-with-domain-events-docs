# 2: Theory - Eventual Consistency

Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in both non-distributed and distributed systems to ensure data
consistency over time.

## In a non-distributed system

In a non-distributed system, eventual consistency refers to the state where the system may temporarily have inconsistent
data, but eventually reaches a consistent state as updates propagate through the system. This can occur due to factors
such as caching, background processing, or asynchronous updates. The system tolerates temporary inconsistencies in favor
of performance or availability, with the expectation that the system will converge to a consistent state over time.

## In a distributed system

In a distributed system, eventual consistency is a more prominent concept, as it involves data replication and
partitioning across multiple nodes. This model allows the system to prioritize high availability and performance
by allowing temporary inconsistencies between replicas. Updates propagate asynchronously across nodes, and the system
eventually reaches a consistent state once all updates have been spread and applied. While providing advantages
in terms of scalability and fault tolerance, eventual consistency can pose challenges in application design, as it
requires handling potential data inconsistencies and conflicts.

## In the context of Domain Driven Design (DDD)

Eventual consistency, when combined with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and its concept of domain events, can provide a
robust approach to managing data consistency and system complexity in both non-distributed and distributed systems.

Domain events are significant occurrences within a system's domain that capture the result of a business operation or a
state change. They are used to decouple components and propagate information about changes in the domain, which helps
in managing the complexity of the system.

In a non-distributed system, domain events can be used in conjunction with eventual consistency to improve system
responsiveness and maintainability. Instead of immediately applying changes to the data, the system can emit domain
events that represent the business operation's outcome. These events can then be asynchronously processed by event
handlers, which update the system's state or trigger further actions. This approach allows for temporary inconsistencies
in the system, but it will eventually reach a consistent state once all events are processed.

In a distributed system, domain events play a more critical role in achieving eventual consistency. As the system is
composed of multiple nodes, domain events serve as a communication mechanism to propagate state changes between nodes.
This helps to maintain consistency across replicas in the face of network latency, partitioning, or node failures.
By leveraging domain events, a distributed system can achieve high availability and fault tolerance while ensuring that
the system converges to a consistent state over time.

However, using domain events and eventual consistency in both non-distributed and distributed systems introduces
complexities in application design. Developers need to consider the implications of eventual consistency when designing
domain models, event handlers, and conflict resolution strategies. This requires a deep understanding of the domain, its
invariants, and the trade-offs between consistency, performance, and availability.

## Conflict resolution strategies

Conflict resolution strategies in event-driven distributed systems deal with the problem of handling conflicting updates
to the same piece of data. This is especially crucial in eventual consistency models where data is not immediately
consistent across all nodes in the system but becomes consistent over time.

Here are a few commonly used conflict resolution strategies:

- **Last Write Wins (LWW):** This is the simplest strategy where the latest update is considered as the winner. However,
  this method can often lead to data loss if the system clock is not perfectly synchronized across all nodes, or if
  updates occur so close together that the "last" write isn't clearly defined.

- **Source priority:** In this approach, each source or node in a distributed system is assigned a priority. In the
  event of a conflict, the update from the higher priority source is chosen. However, this approach can be problematic
  if a high-priority source starts generating incorrect updates.

- **Operational transformation (OT):** This strategy is often used in real-time collaborative applications (like Google
  Docs). The main idea is to transform operations so that the order of execution does not matter. For example, if one
  operation is "add 'a' at position 0" and another operation is "add 'b' at position 1", it doesn't matter which 
  operation is executed first.

- **Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs):** CRDTs are data structures that allow concurrent updates from
  different
  nodes, and they can automatically resolve conflicts in a deterministic manner. There are two types of CRDTs:
  operation-based (where operations are reliably broadcast to all replicas) and state-based (where state is merged by
  taking the "join" of two states).

- **Version vectors/Vector clocks:** These are used to track the causality of events. If two events are concurrent and
  conflict, a decision needs to be made. This could be based on a simple policy like LWW, or a more complex one based on
  the application's needs.

- **Application-specific conflict resolution:** Sometimes, the nature of the data or the application can guide the
  conflict
  resolution. For example, in a banking application, if two conflicting transactions are detected, the system might
  resolve the conflict by aborting one transaction and retrying it later.

The best conflict resolution strategy often depends on the specific requirements of your system and the nature of your
data.
