# 2: Theory - Eventual Consistency
Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in both non-distributed and distributed systems to ensure data consistency over time.

## In a non-distributed system
In a non-distributed system, eventual consistency refers to the state where the system may temporarily have inconsistent
data, but eventually reaches a consistent state as updates propagate through the system. This can occur due to factors
such as caching, background processing, or asynchronous updates. The system tolerates temporary inconsistencies in favor
of performance or availability, with the expectation that the system will converge to a consistent state over time.

## In a distributed system
In a distributed system, eventual consistency is a more prominent concept, as it involves data replication and 
partitioning across multiple nodes. This model allows the system to prioritize high availability and performance 
by allowing temporary inconsistencies between replicas. Updates propagate asynchronously across nodes, and the system 
eventually reaches a consistent state once all updates have been spread and applied. While providing advantages 
in terms of scalability and fault tolerance, eventual consistency can pose challenges in application design, as it 
requires handling potential data inconsistencies and conflicts.

## In the context of Domain Driven Design (DDD)
Eventual consistency, when combined with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and its concept of domain events, can provide a 
robust approach to managing data consistency and system complexity in both non-distributed and distributed systems.

Domain events are significant occurrences within a system's domain that capture the result of a business operation or a 
state change. They are used to decouple components and propagate information about changes in the domain, which helps 
in managing the complexity of the system.

In a non-distributed system, domain events can be used in conjunction with eventual consistency to improve system 
responsiveness and maintainability. Instead of immediately applying changes to the data, the system can emit domain 
events that represent the business operation's outcome. These events can then be asynchronously processed by event 
handlers, which update the system's state or trigger further actions. This approach allows for temporary inconsistencies
in the system, but it will eventually reach a consistent state once all events are processed.

In a distributed system, domain events play a more critical role in achieving eventual consistency. As the system is 
composed of multiple nodes, domain events serve as a communication mechanism to propagate state changes between nodes. 
This helps to maintain consistency across replicas in the face of network latency, partitioning, or node failures. 
By leveraging domain events, a distributed system can achieve high availability and fault tolerance while ensuring that 
the system converges to a consistent state over time.

However, using domain events and eventual consistency in both non-distributed and distributed systems introduces 
complexities in application design. Developers need to consider the implications of eventual consistency when designing 
domain models, event handlers, and conflict resolution strategies. This requires a deep understanding of the domain, its
invariants, and the trade-offs between consistency, performance, and availability.
