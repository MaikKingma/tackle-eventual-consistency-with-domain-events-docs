# 1: Workshop Intro
Welcome to the **Tackle Eventual Consistency with Domain Events** Meetup at the/experts HQ in Breda.
My name is Maik Kingma, and I will be your coach for today. Since I cannot be with everyone simultaneously, 
these docs will provide you with a step-by-step guide.

## Getting Help
I will do my best to answer all the questions that you may have. Just raise a hand or shout out to anyone with a the/experts shirt to get some assistance. Keep validating your own work with the provided tests.
In case you get stuck somewhere along the way, you can either use the prepared TDD branches in each task for a more guided approach, or 
check out the solution branch named `task01/*_DONE` at the end.

### TDD
If you want there is the possibility to do Test Driven Development. At the end of a chapter you
will find happy flow unit tests, in some cases also an integration test. You can use these to do TDD.
If you want an even more guided approach, I prepared a TDD branch for each task in the repository, named something like `task01/*_TDD`


### What you will need
- JDK 17 or higher (the example solutions are based on Java 21)
- Docker Desktop
- An IDE of your choice (ideally IntelliJ)
- an internet connection

### Connect with me
Feel free to connect on LinkedIn, Medium, or Twitter(X). I am always happy to chat about software development. (Links are in 
the About section of the header)
