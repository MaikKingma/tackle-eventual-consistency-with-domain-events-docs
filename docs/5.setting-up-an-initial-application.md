# 5: Hands-On - Set up the App

Setting up the project from scratch would take up too much time and focus away from the important content of this 
mini lab. Hence, I took the liberty of preparing a repository that you can fork or clone.

Button to GitHub is located in the header menu. Alternatively, click 
[here](https://github.com/MaikKingma/javaland-clean-hexagonal-onion).

You can either check out the prepared setup branch or, optionally set the project up yourself.

```git checkout setup-done```

If you checked out this branch then you can proceed to the validation step and skip the following _**OPTIONAL**_ steps.
(there are still some mandatory steps after the optional ones). If you chose to set up the project yourself,
 please follow the **_OPTIONAL_** steps.

### OPTIONAL: DO IT YOURSELF

If you feel like you want to do it all yourself you can use Spring Initializr to setup our spring boot project.
- Go to the [Spring Initializr](https://bit.ly/javaland-spring-init)
- Choose your Project Dependency Manager of your choice (Maven or Gradle).
- Choose your Language of choice.
- For the Spring Boot version at least 2.7.0.
- Fill in the Project Metadata as you see fit, but make sure packaging is Jar and the Java version is 17.
- On the right-hand side you can see the add dependencies button. You need to add the following:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - PostgreSQL Driver
  - Liquibase Migration
  - Lombok
  - Spring Boot DevTools (optional)

### OPTIONAL: Your config should be something like this:

### OPTIONAL: Create the clean hexagonal onion folder structure
![package-structure.png](package-structure.png)

### OPTIONAL: Database
add these lines to ``src/main/resources/application.properties``

```properties
# DataSource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/clean-hexagonal-onion-service
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
```

and create a ``./docker-compose.yml`` file and paste this content into it:
```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: clean-hexagonal-onion-service
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -d $${POSTGRES_DB} -U $${POSTGRES_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```

## Validate
Run the docker-compose script from the IDE or from the terminal with ``docker compose up --build``.
Last but not least, in order to avoid errors for now, please comment out the liquibase dependency in your ``./pom.xml``.

> **Note:** You may have to enable annotation processing in your IDE for the Lombok dependency.

Validate that the Spring application starts by running the application (without any errors).

All green? Well done! We are now ready to move on to the next chapter.
