# 5: Hands-On - Set up the Application

Setting up the project from scratch would take up too much time and focus away from the important content of this 
mini lab. Hence, I took the liberty of preparing a repository that you can fork or clone.

There is a button to GitHub located in the header menu. Alternatively, click 
[here](https://github.com/MaikKingma/tackle-eventual-consistency-with-domain-events/tree/get-started).

```git checkout get-started```

## Validate
In order to be able to start our application we need a DB at our disposal. For that purpose, run the docker-compose 
script from the IDE (little green play button in IntelliJ) or from the terminal with ``docker compose up --build``.

> **Note:** You may have to enable annotation processing in your IDE for the Lombok annotations.

Validate that the Spring application starts by running the application (without any errors).
The log output will look something like this:

All green? Well done! We are now ready to move on to the next chapter.
